##      INTRODUCTION
Hello Everyone!
I developed this application to extend knowlege of graph algorithms from University course work.
You can explore different types of pathfinding algorithms included in this repositery with the provided step by step installment method.
I hope you whoever playing around my project enjoy the time!
Thank you!

##      HOW TO PLAY WITH IT?
To play around with the project, you will need the following or higher version of tools.
###     Version explanation (Environment setups)
You will require following environment settings.
1. Git version

###     Step by step installments
1. make sure you have satisfied environemnt settings as discussed above.
2. clone this repositery by typing >> git clone https://github.com/tonyjang0814/Pathfinding-Visualizer.git <<
3. cd into the repositery and and make sure you are in the right directory or repositery.
4. Type >> npm start << on terminal and wait for few seconds until local host page loads up.
5. Enjoy your time!

##      WHAT IS IN THIS PROJECT
###     Features (visual demonstrations)
1. Wall

Walls can be created by dragging mouse. While pathfinding algorithm searches for paths, such walls are
ignored as it is considered as "obstacle".
Both the start and end Nodes(highlighted as blue and red color) can be moved for your choice as well.
